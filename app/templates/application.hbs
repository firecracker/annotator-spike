Introduction

This is a sample case that illustrates how Firecracker’s content is constructed to show nearly limitless combinations of learning objectives. Our content can be used to focus on clinical sciences, basic sciences, practice management, or some combination. This case does not include all possible content items that are related to it—there simply isn’t adequate room for it all in a simple word document. Firecracker can provide specific content items depending on the goals and other curriculum items of a school.

</p>
<p>
Firecracker can also recommend specific content items depending on the mastery of individual students. One student might start this case and then go down the glycolysis and anaerobic metabolism route, while another student may be asked questions about autonomic nervous compensatory mechanisms.

Questions: All questions are highlighted in green.  Not all questions are answered/explained since some questions are only provided to illustrate the different directions this case could go. Given the number of possibilities for this case, not all possible questions are included. It would be very easy for us to include more questions with accompanying answers and explanations depending on the specific goals of the case. The questions and material could be geared towards 1st and 2nd year students with emphasis on basic sciences, mechanisms, pathology, etc… or it could be geared more towards clinical medicine with an emphasis on diagnosis and management.

</p>
<p>
Basic Sciences/Step 1 specific content: Any content that is more appropriate for content covered during 1st and 2nd year medical school will be written in magenta.  Additionally, anything written in this color will include a hyperlink to example topics, direct recall questions, clinical vignette questions, multiple choice questions, and concepts that are part of Firecracker’s content.  During the process of reviewing a case, students would be able to review these content items.  Firecracker’s algorithm will then recommend that they review the appropriate content items depending on their demonstrated understanding.  Some material that is labeled as Step 1 could be appropriate for Step 2 and vice versa.

</p>
<p>
Clinical Clerkships/Step 2 specific content: Any content that is more appropriate for content covered during 3rd and 4th year medical school will be written in pink.  Just like the Step 1 content, it will contain a hyperlink that will take you to sample content items that are related to the material discussed in that portion of the case.

</p>
<p>
Basic Science AND Clinical Clerkship Content:  When there is content that is pertinent to both the basic sciences and clinical clerkships, there will be links in parenthesis in blue that will take you to the pertinent content. BS=basic sciences, CK=clinical clerkships.

</p>
<p>
DRQ: Direct Recall Question, these are open-ended questions that test recall of granular facts and concepts.  The answer to a DRQ is the concept immediately above the question.

CV: Clinical Vignette, a multiple choice question preceded by a clinical vignette. This is the standard question format on USMLE Step 1 and USMLE Step 2CK. 

Comments: Given the enormous possibilities for this case, I had to limit what we can include otherwise it would become cluttered. Where appropriate I have included comments to illustrate how this case might lead to other learning points, topics, review questions, and so on. Each comment is highlighted with a light orange color. Click on the highlighted text, and the associated comment will come into view. 

Note that linked content is written on a series of Google Docs for ease of access.  Such content would normally be displayed on Firecracker’s platform, complete with accompanying references, multimedia, and links to other resources.

Case
Initial presentation
An 11-month-old female presents to the emergency department with fever (CK, BS).  Her parents report that she has also been eating and drinking less than usual.  She has been sleeping more than usual and fussy when awake. 

What more would you like to know about this patient?
When did these symptoms start?
How have these symptoms progressed/changed?
What has the patient/parent done to address the patient’s current presentation/symptoms?
Alleviating factors
Exacerbating factors
What other symptoms does the patient have?
What is the patient’s medical history?
What is the patient’s immunization history?
What is the patient’s family history?
What is the patient’s living and social situation?

Symptom onset, progression, and alleviating or exacerbating factors
The patient’s fussiness and decreased oral intake started three days ago, and her parents initially attributed these symptoms to teething.  However, two days ago she began to have fever (CK, BS) up to 104°F.  She experienced only one episode of fever in the evening on the first day, but today she has been febrile throughout the day.  Her temperature decreases temporarily with ibuprofen but rises again within a few hours.  Her parents have noted that her heart rate seems fast but thought this was due to fever.  Over the past day, she has become less active and alert.  She usually naps for an hour each day, but her parents report that she has been sleeping for the past six or seven hours.  They have been trying to encourage her to drink, but she has had only one wet diaper all day. 

Associated symptoms 
The patient’s parents deny that she has any other symptoms than those described above.  Specifically, they say she has had no cough, rhinorrhea, or nasal congestion.  She has not been pulling at her ears.  She has had no vomiting or diarrhea.  They have noted no rashes.

Medical history
The patient was born at 39 weeks estimated gestational age via spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy.  She went home after two days in the newborn nursery.  She had one episode of viral croup at age five months and one episode of otitis media at age eight months but has otherwise been healthy.  She has required no hospitalizations and has had no surgeries.  She takes no chronic prescription or over the counter medications.  She has no known allergies.  She is growing well and developing normally.

Immunization history
The patient’s immunizations are up to date for age, including three doses of each of the following vaccines: hepatitis B; diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis; rotavirus; Haemophilus influenzae type B; pneumococcal conjugate; and inactivated poliovirus.  She has also received two doses of influenza vaccine.

Family history
The patient’s mother and two maternal aunts have allergic rhinitis and asthma.  The patient’s paternal grandfather and uncle have hypertension and coronary artery disease.  A paternal uncle has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  There is no family history of primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, leukemia or early childhood cancers, or early childhood deaths.

Living and social situation and exposure history
The patient lives with her mother, father, and four-year-old brother.  The family has two cats and a dog; she has no exposures to other animals.  Her father is a mechanical engineer.  Her mother works part-time as a school librarian.  The patient attends daycare three days per week.  No one else in the family has been sick recently, and the patient has had no other known sick contacts.  Her diet consists of breastmilk and age-appropriate table foods; she has not consumed undercooked fish or meat or unpasteurized dairy products, and the family drinks bottled water.  They have not traveled during the past six months. 
 
You perform a physical exam, which reveals the following:
General: Ill-appearing, pale.  Temperature (rectal) 39.9°C (103.8°F), pulse 184/min, blood pressure 75/45 mm Hg, respirations 60/min, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light; conjunctivae clear.  Tympanic membranes pearly-gray and mobile bilaterally.  Nares clear.  Oropharynx without erythema or lesions.
Neck: Supple, no meningismus.
Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, regular rhythm; normal S1 and S2; no murmur, rub, or gallop.
Abdomen: Soft, nondistended; difficult to assess tenderness due to patient’s lethargy.  No hepatosplenomegaly; normoactive bowel sounds.
Lymphatic: No cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
Extremities: Cool but not cyanotic; 2+ peripheral pulses; capillary refill 3 s.
Neurologic: Moves all extremities; no focal deficits.
Psych: Sleeping, arousable for periods of a a minute or two during which she cries and clings to her father.
Musculoskeletal: Symmetrical with normal range of motion; no joint swelling.
Skin: No rashes or lesions.

What is your initial assessment of this patient’s status and likely diagnosis?
The patient has a history of high fever without apparent source, decreased activity and alertness, and decreased urine output.  Her vital signs show tachycardia, a blood pressure at the low end of normal for her age, and tachypnea.  In addition, on exam she is ill-appearing, pale, and lethargic with cool extremities and delayed capillary refill.  All of these findings are concerning for shock (CK, BS), with sepsis as the most likely etiology given that the patient is a previously healthy infant.

In fact, this patient’s condition meets the definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which consists of widespread inflammation that may be due to infection or other causes.  A diagnosis of SIRS requires fulfilling two or more of the following criteria (one of which must be abnormal temperature or leukocyte count):
<!--Central temperature >38.5°C or <36.0°C-->
<!--Tachycardia (defined as pulse >2SD above normal for age); or for infants <1 year of age, bradycardia (defined as pulse <10th percentile for age)-->
<!--Tachypnea, defined as respirations >2 SD above normal for age-->
<!--Elevated or decreased leukocyte count (based on normal range for age), or >10% immature neutrophils-->
<!--The patient already meets criteria 1, 2 (pulse >180), and 3 (respirations >34).  Notably, hypotension is not a required finding for diagnosis of shock in children because they tend to maintain blood pressure through tachycardia and increased vascular resistance.  Hypotension is therefore a late sign of SIRS.-->

What are the differences in SIRS criteria between pediatric patients and adults?

What should be your next step in management?
The patient requires rapid establishment of intravenous access and fluid resuscitation, initially with a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution.  Her vital signs and exam should then be reassessed and further 20 mL/kg boluses administered as needed until her perfusion is adequate.

What labs and studies do you want to order and why?
Arterial or venous blood gas: Assess for metabolic acidosis (due to inadequate tissue perfusion and lactic acidosis) and compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential: Assess for high or low leukocyte count (part of the SIRS criteria and indicators of infection), as well as high or low neutrophil count (also indicators of infection) and high (due to inflammation) or low (due to disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) platelet count.
Comprehensive metabolic panel: Evaluate for electrolyte disturbances that may occur due to processes associated with septic shock, such as capillary leak; elevated blood urea nitrogen (indicating dehydration) and serum creatinine (indicating prerenal azotemia or renal dysfunction); and other evidence of end organ dysfunction (e.g., elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or bilirubin indicating hepatic dysfunction).
Blood lactate level: Assess for lactic acidosis.  Following lactate levels is thought to be a useful determination of the adequacy of therapy because improving lactate levels may reflect tissue reperfusion.
Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen levels): Evaluate for coagulopathy and DIC.
Blood culture: Evaluate for bacteremia as bloodstream infections are common in children with sepsis. It is important to draw blood for cultures before beginning any kind of antibiotic therapy.
Urinalysis and urine culture (catheterized): Assess for evidence of a urinary tract infection, which is a common source of infection in children with sepsis. 
Chest x-ray: Assess for pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

After ordering labs, what is the next step in managing this patient?
Once specimens are obtained for blood and urine cultures, she should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.  All children with septic shock should be covered for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus given that community acquisition of this pathogen has become common.  Selection of other agents is based on a patient’s underlying risk factors and drug allergies.  Because this patient is immunocompetent based on her medical history, a suggested empiric regimen is vancomycin and ceftriaxone.



Initial results of labs and studies:
Arterial blood gas: pH 7.32, PaO2 90 mm Hg, PaCO2 28 mm Hg, HCO3- 16 mEq/L
CBC with differential: Leukocyte count 19,820/mm3 (76% neutrophils, 12% bands, 8% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 1% eosinophils); hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL and hematocrit 35.8%; platelet count 88,000/mm3
Comprehensive metabolic panel: Normal except for creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Blood lactate level: 4 mmol/L
Coagulation studies: PT 19 s, aPTT 30 s, fibrinogen 200 mg/dL
Urinalysis: Positive for nitrite, leukocyte esterase; 20 WBC/hpf, 0-2 RBC/hpf, numerous bacteria
Chest x-ray: Clear lung fields bilaterally; normal heart size; no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Explanation of elevated lactate
The pathophysiology of septic shock (CK, BS) is still being elucidated but is known to involve a complex interaction between the pathogen in question and the host’s immune response, the purpose of which is to localize and contain the microbial invasion.  Various components of bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens can trigger the host’s defense mechanisms.  Examples of conserved microbial molecules that trigger the host’s defense include bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagella, viral double-stranded DNA, and other conserved microbial molecules.

In septic shock, these microbial products trigger the release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1, IFN-𝛾, which causes widespread inflammation.  This generalized inflammation activates multiple process in endothelial cells:
upregulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules
production of more cytokines and chemokines
loosening of intercellular tight junctions
upregulation of nitric oxide (NO) production.
The loosening of tight junctions results in fluid leakage.  As fluid moves from the vasculature to the tissue, the effective circulating blood volume decreases and hypotension results.

Vasodilation on its own causes a decrease in blood pressure as well.  As noted above, children tend to compensate well initially through tachycardia and increased systemic vascular resistance, but hypotension can eventually develop as a late sign of septic shock.  Hypotension is worsened as blood pools in the dilated venous system.  Blood pooling in the venous system decreases venous return and preload.  Decreased preload causes decreases cardiac contractility, which reduces cardiac output.  Decreased cardiac output and hypotension both contribute to impaired tissue perfusion.

Impaired perfusion manifests with signs such as those seen in this patient: pallor, cool extremities, delayed capillary refill, altered mental status (including lethargy and irritability), and oliguria.  Decreased perfusion results in tissue hypoxia.  Normal cellular metabolism is dependent on oxygen.  As oxygen levels drop, cells must switch to anaerobic cellular metabolism.

Normal cellular production of ATP utilizes glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain (ETC).  Glycolysis requires NAD+, which it converts to the electron carrier NADH.  NADH is an important substrate in the electron transport chain (ETC), the process that generates vast amounts of ATP.  Normal functioning of the ETC requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor.  Because of tissue hypoxia in septic shock, there is inadequate oxygen available to accept electrons carried by NADH.  NADH builds up in cells and is not converted back to NAD+.  If there was no way to increase levels of NAD+, then glycolysis would stop and ATP production would halt.

Ideally the cell would be able to produce ATP via glycolysis and the ETC.  But since oxygen isn’t available, it will try to produce at least small amounts of ATP via glycolysis exclusively.  In order to regenerate NAD+ and allow for ATP production via glycolysis to continue, pyruvate is converted to lactic acid.  In this reaction, NADH is converted back to NAD+, and glycolysis is able to resume (see diagram).



With widespread anaerobic cellular respiration, lactic acid levels rise, producing a lactic acidosis.  This is noted in this patient’s labs as a drop in pH and elevated lactate levels.

While the pathogenesis of septic shock induced lactic acidosis is complex and multiple steps are occurring simultaneously, it can be conceptualized stepwise as follows:

Widespread inflammation → vasodilation and fluid leakage
Vasodilation and fluid leakage → hypotension
Hypotension → decreased tissue perfusion
Decreased tissue perfusion → tissue hypoxia
Tissue hypoxia → shunting of cellular metabolism from aerobic processes to anaerobic processes
Anaerobic metabolism → no utilization of the ETC → build-up of NADH and depletion of NAD+
Increased NADH/NAD+ ratio → conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid
Pyruvate conversion to lactic acid → increased NAD+ and continued ATP production via glycolysis


Subsequent course:
The patient is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management.  Despite continued fluid administration, she develops hypotension and requires a low-dose dopamine infusion.  Within several hours, however, she is able to wean off of dopamine and maintain stable blood pressures.

What is the mechanism of action of dopamine and its role in the management of shock?

By hospital day 2, the patient  is found to have rales on exam and develops hypoxia for which she is started on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.  A repeat chest x-ray shows diffuse pulmonary edema.  

What is the underlying cause of pulmonary edema in this patient?

How should this patient’s pulmonary edema be managed?

She responds well to initiation of furosemide with increased urine output and a decreasing oxygen requirement.

What is the mechanism of action of furosemide?

What is the role of furosemide in this patient’s current condition?

Within 24 hours of collection, her urine culture becomes positive for >100,000 CFU/mL of a gram-negative bacillus.  The organism is identified as Escherichia coli, confirming a diagnosis of E. coli urosepsis.  The isolate is susceptible to all antibiotics tested, including ceftriaxone.  The patient’s blood culture becomes positive for E. coli, as well.  

How is sensitivity to antibiotics determined?

Blood and urine cultures are still incubated, and after 48 hours there is no more growth other than the E. coli.

Should any changes be made to the patient’s current treatment? Why or why not?

Antibiotic therapy is an important area where judicious use of resources is critical to individual and population wellbeing.  The overuse of antibiotics is causing increasing levels of resistance to these therapies.  Antibiotic resistant organisms are a growing source of morbidity, mortality, and increasing healthcare costs.  In individual patients, antibiotics are not without side effects either.  They are also expensive.

If someone is being treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, it is imperative that efforts be made to de-escalate antibiotic therapy as soon as possible.  This is generally done by identifying the specific organism and its antibiotic sensitivity and/or resolving the infection.

In this patient, there is a clear source of her sepsis:  E. coli bacteremia from a UTI.  There is nothing else that grows on culture, so antibiotic therapy can be targeted to that specific organism.  Since this patient was already started on ceftriaxone, and the organism is susceptible to ceftriaxone, then this therapy should be continued.  There is no need to continue vancomycin, which is primarily used for MRSA.


Subsequent course
Vancomycin is discontinued once cultures have incubated for 48 hours and the patient has clinically stabilized.  Repeat blood cultures obtained on hospital days 2 and 3 are negative.

The patient defervesces by hospital day 3 and becomes more alert and interactive.  She is transferred to a general pediatric ward on hospital day 4.  

When would this patient be safe for discharge home?

After another day of observation during which she remains afebrile, weans off of oxygen, and has increasing oral intake, she is discharged to home.

What treatment should the patient be sent home with?

The patient is discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) to complete a 14-day course of ceftriaxone.

Should any further workup be done on this patient? Why or why not?

An outpatient renal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. 

The renal ultrasound is recommended as evaluation for structural abnormalities in general that could have predisposed the patient to developing a UTI.  It would also be useful for showing nephrolithiasis, another predisposing factor.  A renal ultrasound is standard practice based on the American Academy of Pediatrics practice guidelines for diagnosis and management of an initial febrile UTI in infants and children 2 to 24 months of age.  Here's a link to the guidelines.
